             <p> <b>Mobile Legends bang bang</b> or also known as MLBB is an online multiplayer game.
                  Each match consists 2 teams.In oredr for you to win a match, you must destroy the enemy's base.
                  The game is available for free and is only monetized through in-game purchases such as characters and skins. 
                  Each player controls a distinct "Hero" character with unique abilities and traits.
                  The basic objective of heroes is defined by six roles:"Tank," "Marksman," "Assassin," "Fighter," "Mage," and "Support."
                  These positions define each player's responsibilities for their respective teams. 
                  Players can also customize their heroes' builds, which include in-game equipment and emblems.</p>
